# nexivora.space — deploy

**This folder does not deploy Nexivora the application.** It uploads one static
holding page. Read why before changing anything here.

## The constraint

The FTP credentials for `nexivora.space` are shared hosting on the same
Hostinger account as `truthordare.fun` (`u836338583.*`, FTP-only, `default.php`
sitting at the root when we first connected). Shared hosting serves static
files and PHP. It has no persistent Node.js process behind it, and Nexivora is
a live Next.js app — server actions, sessions, PostgreSQL, real-time
notifications. None of that runs over FTP, no matter how the upload script is
written. The full reasoning and the recommended path are in
[`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](../../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) at the repo root — this
folder is downstream of that document, not a way around it.

(SSH is open on port 65002 for this Hostinger account, which usually means a
Business/Cloud plan with hPanel's "Setup Node.js App" available. That still
only gives MySQL, not the PostgreSQL Nexivora needs, so it does not change the
conclusion — and in any case we only hold the FTP sub-account password, not
the SSH/hPanel login.)

## What this folder actually does

Uploads `site/` — one real, on-brand HTML page (the actual logo mark, the
actual color tokens, the actual tagline from `src/config/site.ts`) — so
`nexivora.space` shows something intentional instead of Hostinger's default
parking page while the real application is deployed elsewhere.

```bash
cd deploy/nexivora-space
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # fill in FTP_PASSWORD
npm run deploy:dry-run      # see what would upload, uploads nothing
npm run deploy               # upload site/ to nexivora.space
```

Same `basic-ftp` pattern as `TruthOrDare/deploy.js` on this account, minus the
build step — there is nothing to build; `site/index.html` is committed as-is
and edited directly.

## The actual deployment (do this, not more holding-page tweaks)

`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` §"Stage 3" and the free-tier table above it lay out the
real path: **Render (free, runs Node) + Neon (free Postgres)** is the
fastest route to a fully working Nexivora with no VPS purchase. There is a
[`render.yaml`](../../render.yaml) at the repo root so this is a blueprint
click rather than hand-configuring a service:

1. Create a free account at **neon.tech** → New project → copy the **pooled**
   connection string. Keep the tab open, you need it in step 3.
2. Click **[Deploy to Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/achaudhary7/nexivora)**.
   Signing in with GitHub is the fastest path (one OAuth click, also grants
   Render the repo access it needs) — no separate signup form.
3. Render reads `render.yaml` from the repo automatically and asks you to
   fill in three values it can't know on its own:
   - `DATABASE_URL` — the Neon string from step 1.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and `AUTH_URL` — leave a placeholder for the
     first deploy (e.g. `https://nexivora.onrender.com`), then come back and
     set the real `.onrender.com` URL Render assigns you, redeploy once.
     Update both again, once, after the DNS step below.
   - Everything else (`AUTH_SECRET`, `NODE_ENV`, etc.) is already set in
     `render.yaml`.
4. First deploy runs migrations automatically (`prisma migrate deploy` is
   part of the build command) and seeds nothing — Render is not the demo
   database, it's meant to hold real data. If you want the demo world on it
   too, run `npm run db:seed` once against the Neon `DATABASE_URL` from your
   own machine.
5. In Hostinger's **hPanel** (not FTP — this needs the account login, which
   this folder does not have) point `nexivora.space` at the Render service:
   a `CNAME` to the `.onrender.com` host, or Render's custom-domain flow for
   an apex domain (Render's dashboard tells you exactly which record to add
   once you type in the domain).

**Two honest limits of the free tier, so they don't surprise you:**

- **Files vanish on redeploy.** `STORAGE_DRIVER=local` writes into the
  container's filesystem, which Render free tier does not persist across
  restarts or redeploys. Fine for a demo/pilot; before real users upload
  things they need kept, switch to the `r2` storage driver (Cloudflare R2
  free tier — the interface already exists, see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`).
- **Verification emails print to Render's logs, they don't send**, because
  `EMAIL_TRANSPORT=console`. Nobody can complete sign-up until this is
  switched to `smtp` with real credentials (Hostinger's own SMTP on this
  account works, or a free Brevo account) — see the "EMAIL" section of
  `app/.env.example` for the variable names.

Once the real app is live, this holding page is no longer needed — either
leave it as a landing page that links to the app, or stop deploying to it and
let the DNS change take over entirely.
