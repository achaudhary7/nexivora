 * here points at a row that also exists, because that is the invariant the
 * whole feature rests on: a contribution record that can drift from the actions
 * that produced it is worse than no record, since it still looks authoritative.
 * `scripts/verify-db.mjs` asserts exactly this, and it should be impossible to
