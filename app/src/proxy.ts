/**
 * ROUTE GATING.
 *
 * **This is a convenience, not the security boundary.** It exists so a signed-out
 * visitor lands on the sign-in page instead of a broken dashboard, and so they
 * come back where they were going afterwards. It is not what protects data.
 *
 * The data is protected by `visibleTo(viewer)` in the query layer and `can()`
 * in the policy, both of which run whether or not this file did. That ordering
 * is deliberate and Phase 4's acceptance criterion 3 tests it directly: a
 * cross-college read must return null **with this disabled**.
 *
 * Next 16 renamed Middleware to Proxy (ADR-014). The file is `proxy.ts` and the
 * export is `proxy`. A `middleware.ts` here would be *silently ignored* — no
 * error, no warning, just an ungated application — which is exactly the kind of
 * failure worth a comment.
 *
 * Proxy runs on every matched request and may be deployed to a CDN edge, so it
 * does no database work and reads only the cookie's presence. Whether the
 * session is *valid* is decided by `currentViewer()` on the server, where a
 * database is available.
