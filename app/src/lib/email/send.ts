 * testable with no SMTP server, no mail account and no network, which is the
 * difference between these flows being exercised constantly and being exercised
 * once before launch.
 *
 * There is no HTML templating engine here on purpose. These are five short
 * transactional messages; a layout function and template literals are easier to
 * read, easier to keep accessible, and do not add a dependency that renders
 * untrusted input.
