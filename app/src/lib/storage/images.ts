/**
 * PROFILE AND BRAND IMAGES — avatars, cover images, college logos.
 *
 * Separate from the workspace file path, and deliberately so. A group's file is
 * private to that group and reached through an authorisation check on every
 * request. An avatar is the opposite: it appears beside its owner's name
 * wherever they appear, including on a public project page that a logged-out
 * visitor is reading, so putting it behind the workspace check would break
 * every public surface in the product.
 *
 * The constraints that make that safe:
 *
 *  · **Images only**, verified by magic bytes like everything else. A `.pdf`
 *    named `avatar.png` is refused here for the same reason it is in a
 *    workspace.
 *  · **SVG is refused outright**, not merely served as an attachment. An avatar
 *    is rendered through `<img>` in dozens of places; an uploaded SVG is markup
 *    that can carry script, and the one thing worse than inlining it would be
 *    inlining it beside somebody's name (docs/SECURITY.md §3).
 *  · **2 MB**, well under the 25 MB workspace cap. An avatar is displayed at
 *    24–80px and a 20 MB one is a mistake, not a requirement.
 *
 * The stored object is served from `/api/images/[id]`, which is public by
 * design and carries a long cache. The key is unguessable, so a replaced image
 * simply stops being referenced rather than needing invalidation.
