/**
 * THE ONLY PATH TO A USER FILE.
 *
 * There is no static URL for an upload. Files live outside the web root and
 * reach a browser exclusively through this handler, which resolves the row,
 * asks `can(viewer, 'workspace:read', group)` and only then streams bytes.
 * Acceptance criterion 5 is the test of it: a file uploaded by group A returns
 * 404 to a member of group B, at the real URL.
 *
 * **404, never 403.** A refusal that distinguishes "not yours" from "not there"
 * confirms the file exists, and the existence of a named file inside a named
 * group is itself information — the same reasoning as ADR-034 for profiles.
 * Every failure below returns the identical response.
 *
 * **Reading is `workspace:read`, not a new action.** Reading a group's file
 * *is* reading the workspace. Inventing a `file:read` action would put a second
 * decision next to an existing one, and two permission checks about the same
 * thing drift until the more permissive one wins.
 *
 * Three response rules, each from docs/SECURITY.md:
 *
 *  · `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on everything, so a text file cannot be
 *    re-interpreted as script by a browser being helpful.
 *  · `Content-Disposition: attachment` for anything not previewable — and SVG
 *    is deliberately *not* previewable, because it is markup that can carry
 *    script (§3).
 *  · A restrictive `Content-Security-Policy` on the response itself, so even a
 *    document served inline cannot load or call anything.
