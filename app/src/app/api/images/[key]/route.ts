/**
 * PUBLIC IMAGES — avatars, cover images, college logos.
 *
 * **Deliberately unauthenticated**, which is the opposite of `/api/files/[id]`
 * and worth stating plainly rather than leaving to be discovered.
 *
 * An avatar appears beside its owner's name wherever they appear, including on
 * a public project page a logged-out visitor is reading. Gating it would break
 * every public surface in the product, and gating it *conditionally* would mean
 * a second visibility rule living next to the one in `getProfile()` — which is
 * exactly the drift ADR-033 exists to prevent.
 *
 * What makes that acceptable is what is on the other side of the URL:
 *
 *  · The key is a **128-bit random name** (`storageKey()`), so these are not
 *    enumerable. Somebody who has the URL was given it by a page they were
 *    entitled to read.
 *  · Only verified image types are ever written here, and **SVG is refused at
 *    upload** — so nothing served from this path is markup.
 *  · The response is still `nosniff` and sandboxed, so a byte sequence that
 *    somehow got here cannot be re-interpreted as a document.
 *
 * A private profile does not render its avatar to anyone, so the URL is not
 * disclosed. That is the same protection a private project's cover has, and it
 * is honestly weaker than an authorisation check — which is why nothing
 * sensitive is ever stored through this path.
