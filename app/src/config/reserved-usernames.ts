/**
 * Usernames nobody may take.
 *
 * A username is a top-level URL — `/p/ananya-sharma` today, but the reserved
 * list also covers the case where a future route moves a handle to the root.
 * More immediately: a username that matches a route segment produces links that
 * look right and go somewhere else, and there is no way to fix it afterwards
 * without breaking somebody's public URL.
 *
 * Three categories, and each is here for a different reason:
 *
 *  · **Routes**, present and plausible. `admin`, `settings`, `explore`.
 *  · **Impersonation risks.** `support`, `security`, `billing`, `noreply` — a
 *    message from `nexivora-support` is a phishing vector whoever sends it.
 *  · **Infrastructure conventions.** `www`, `api`, `cdn`, `static`, `.well-known`.
 *
 * Acceptance criterion 6: a username cannot be taken that would shadow an
 * existing route. `username.test.ts` asserts this against the real route list
 * rather than against this file, so a route added later without a reservation
 * fails the test instead of shipping.
